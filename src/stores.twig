                        We’re a small, local company based in Shirahama with a simple mission: create exceptional t-shirts that this region deserves.
                        <br /><br />
                        The market is flooded with cheap, mass-produced apparel that falls apart after a few washes. We saw a gap for something better – high-quality garments that actually last, made right here in Kansai using Japanese materials and craftsmanship.
                        <br /><br />
                        Everything happens in-house and on a small scale. We design each piece ourselves, drawing inspiration from Shirahama’s stunning coastline and natural beauty. We work directly with local suppliers and manufacturers who share our commitment to quality over quantity.                    </p>
